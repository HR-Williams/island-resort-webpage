  <h1>Travel To Imaginary Island Resort</h1>
  <p>There are many ways to travel to Imaginary Island Resort. It's all about your budget and your schedule</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong> Hot Air Balloon</strong>: If you're not in a hurry, and also don't mind if you don't actually arrive here, a hot air balloon ride can be the leisurely travel you didn't know you wanted</li>
    <li><strong> Catamaran</strong>: Also for the guest looking for an extended vacation where the journey is just as important as the destination</li>
    <li><strong> Teleportation</strong>: For those who just want to be on vacation already, we reccomend teleporation. You'll have the added adventure of inventing a teleporation device to make this a reality.</li>
  </ul>
